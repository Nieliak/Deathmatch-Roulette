A non-GUI text-based game. 

It has the similar system to Buckshot Roulette, but provides you with a different experience through unique items and kits. 

Currently 4 available kits(more will be added, probably introduce a custom kit mode). 

Amusing PvP, PvE or even EvE modes. 

Language: English, Simplified Chinese. 

**System description:**

1. Two players take turns to use at most one kind of item and then shoot.

2. Each item has its own effect, but you cannot gain more items after using them up.

3. When you shoot your opponent, you will deal 1 (or 0, when you shoot a blank bullet) damage to them.

4. When you shoot yourself, you will deal the same damage. But only if you shoot yourself with a blank bullet, you can have another chance to use your item and shoot.

5. When your clip is empty and it's your turn to shoot, your clip will be reloaded instead of you shooting.

6. The one to kill the other wins.

**Item description:**

_Wine_: Unload the next bullet.

_Knife_: Double the damage dealt by your next shot. 

_Magnifying Glass_: Predict the next bullet.

_Cigarette_: Heal 1 HP.

_Handcuffs_: Continue another turn right after the current one. 

_Pan_: Defend the next shot by the opponent. 

_Spark_: Deal small damage. The damage increases each time it's used. Generates another spark by chance. 

_Cure_: Heal yourself. The portion depends on the lost HP of your opponent. 

_Frost_: Decrease your damage by 0.2 and your opponent's by 0.33.
